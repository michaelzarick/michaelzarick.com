									<h1>I would love to work<br />
									For The Sunrise Movement</h1>
									<p>I believe that I can effectively fit into almost any role you're seeking, as well as being adaptable to many other positions. I custom built this 3D animation of your logo just to assist in proving that point. It's not a perfect animation. If I were to improve it off the tope of my head, I would hold the sun behind the logo at it's peak for a few short moments.</p>

								<p>I have been passionate about politics since the presidential election in 2016. That is what started me on my journey to become an empassioned political pundit over the previous four years, at least in my own social circle. Over that time I have watched our country be continually threatened by ever growing partisanship. To me the most important issues facing us today are climate change, education, and healthcare. I believe if we find a way to better or solve our problems in these areas, almost all other areas of our society will improve. So to me, <a href="https://sunrisemovement.org/" target="_blank"><b>'Sunrise'</b></a> is not just a political organization fighting for justice but a collection of ideas that are necessary actions we must take if we are going to be able to preserve not only life in America as we have known it in the past, but to better the lives of <u>all</u> people in this country and world for the future.</p>

								
								
								<p>So, quite honestly, while I do not have much to show in the way of written documents that express my intuition and knowledge of the world or past work experience that shows my tenacity for this cause, what I do have is a passion and dedication to learning and bettering myself to fit the role I am needed for. I also have this website, its content, and a wide variety of skills that can assist your causes. Nothing is more imporant to me than making a positive change in this country and this world.</p>

								<p>The past few months have been difficult for me and our country in general. Finding work is hard right now. It's amazing that people, while fighting for their rights and their lives, are combatting the system to ask for change. So if there is any job opening with the Sunrise Movement that I could fill I would love to be a part of the fight more directly than I have been. Thank you for your time peaking at this page. I would love to hear back from you.
