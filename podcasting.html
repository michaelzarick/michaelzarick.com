									<h1>Doing the most with the least</h1>
									<p>Getting unemployed in 2020 helped me discover a passion for content creation and an ear for sound editing</p>
								</header>

								<p>In 2020 I was left with no job and a lot of free time. I reached out to my brother to see if he was in need of help with anything with his new company. He mentioned to me that he needed help editing his weekly startup podcast. I was definitely glad to help out, and I was also thankful to have some sort of income in that time so I went to work. This is where I discovered my interest in content and podcast editing. I have not looked back since and I have been having a great time doing so. Unfortunately because of business developments, the podcast has come to an end but I am definitely thanksful for those initial podcasts getting started. Here's an example of some of the work I did for Arrows:</p>

								<p>I was having such a great time doing the podcast for my brother that I got a little excited. I wanted to do my own thing. It didn't work out but in the meantime I had a great experience. I am the type of person who watched quite a bit of live stream content on Twitch.tv. As a result I have a huge amount of insight into the trends and flow of content that comes from the platform. Because of this I gathered a group of folks to begin a podcast talking about those things from our perspective, the perspective of a viewer as opposed to the perspective you normally here which is from the voice of the creator themselves. I had a great time doing our extremely shortlived podcast (which I also edited) and would love for you to take a look:</p>

								<p>This brings me to the more recent times. I'm doing well on a personal level. I have a great job, great relationship, and am overall doing well in life. I wanted to look for a bit more. I was missing the editing that I got to do with my time working with my brother or random freelance jobs on the internet. I've come full circle and am now working with my Step-cousin to edit her podcast. "Friends in the Ville" is a podcast about friends telling stories about their lives, careers, and relationships all centered around Louisville, KY. In my role helping my cousin, I've taken a sort of executive editor position with her, not only doing the brunt of the labor editing the podcast, but also offering advice about format and content of the podcast itself. In the episode coming up this week I am very excited to work on my skills creating a nice intro using some voice clips and audio manipulation taking inspiration from the Call Her Daddy Podcast. Check out my work on Friends on the Vill here: </p>

								<p>I've done quite a bit of other work on the side including work under my current employer creating content. I will share that work listed below and update it as often as I can!</p>
